interview


First things first i used Laragon to deploy the application... 
create a folder called interview

paste everything into the new folder in Laragon

convert all HTML files to PHP 

create an init page which will include all files that will be needed 
create a database folder to hold the files we will use 

create a session for the user
once the session is successful you may log in if it connects to a database if it finds the log in details it moves forward with the new information 

inside the index we have all our tasks create a is marked script to quickly mark the panels
moving over to the manage task First will try and attempt to get the new task button working 

once tha is done i will try move over to the panels and get the edit button working so that we may edit each panel and the the power button not to sure what to make it do but i will asume that i can make it a green button for when in progress and red when done

Under completed task i will show all the Divs that have been check using a session that needs to be created in the my task page i cant then export to a csv or i can delete them all 
or delete individually once our task are working i would a take back button for cases where a tasks needs to be re-done
